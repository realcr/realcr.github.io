	<h2>The Mesh Question</h2> by real, 2014-11-09 18:31
	<h3>Abstract</h3>

<p>We discuss motivation for creating a distributed network instead or on top of
the internet. Then we write down a list of specific requirements from this
network. Finally we introduce the Flooding idea as a naive solution for this
problem, and explain why it won't do.</p>
<h3>Motivation for change</h3>

<p>In <a href="intro_internet.html">Intro to the Internet</a>
we generally discussed how the internet works, and some of the drawbacks of the
current situation. I remind you the main ones: </p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Addressing - A usual participant in the internet usually has no control over his
    address. It is assigned to him. In most cases it also changes from time to
    time. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>NATs - Most of the computers in the internet these days are behind a NAT.
    If two computers are each behind a NAT, they might experience great
    difficulty in the task of initiating conversation. (Though some ad hoc
    methods exist today today. See <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/STUN">Stun</a> as
    an example.)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Operators Greed - The Internet is hierarchical, which gives much power to
    its operators. They might be tempted to find new and interesting ways to
    get more money from the end users of the Internet.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Privacy and Censorship: The hierarchical structure of the internet causes a
    situation where much traffic is routed through few computers. The owners of
    those computers can leverage their advantage to read end users traffic or
    censor specific content.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h3>The search for alternatives</h3>

<p>While some work on solutions inside the Internet itself to solve some of the
issues presented above, it might be interesting to discuss an alternative
structure of connecting computers together.</p>
<p>The main idea proposed in this project is the creation of a new network with a
different structure, that will serve the same purposes as the original
Internet.</p>
<p>As many issues that we mentioned before relate to the hierarchial structure of
the Internet, we will avoid it. We will try to find some other more
decentralized structure, where all the computers have more or less a symmetric
role in the network. This kind of network is sometimes referred to as a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mesh_networking">mesh
network</a>.</p>
<p>We will also want to utilize the current infrastructure of the Internet, as it
is already there, and it works. One idea would be to start a new network on the
Internet itself, and slowly take it out.</p>
<p>Next, we care about security. The Internet was built in the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet#History">sixties and
seventies</a>, and its creators
didn't expect it to be deployed on all the computers in the world. They didn't
design it with security in mind - They just wanted it to work.</p>
<p>Finally, we want the new network to be efficient, or maybe - scalable. We want
it to be able to connect all the computers in the world, and still have good
performance. Performance that is comparable with today's Internet.</p>
<h3>Isolating the question</h3>

<p>We have a \(n\) computers scattered around the world. (Or maybe in some other
places, it you like). \(n\) is a large number. You may assume \(n = 
2^{40}\). We want to wire them somehow and choose a program that
all of them run (The same program for all of them!), so that we get the
following properties:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Addressing</strong>: We can give names or addresses to different computers on
  the network. Then those names could be used to initiate communications with
  remote computers on the network.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Routability</strong>: We are able to send messages to remote computers on the network,
  given their address. Those messages arrive with some constant high enough
  probability, in amount of time poly logarithmic in \(n\). 
  (\(O(P(log n))\) where \(P\) is some non evil Polynomial).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Symmetry</strong>: All the computers in the network have the same role, or at least
  the potential to be in the same role. All the computers in the network run
  the same program.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Scalability</strong>: Sending a message in the network disturbs no more than \(P(log
  n)\) computers. Basically it means that routing a message in the network can
  not involve too many computers in the network.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Network Justice</strong>: A computer in the network that sends lots of data will not
  be able to disturb other computers in the network to send and receive
  messages. (Of course we will have to define somehow what is lots of data,
  though this is just a general idea of a property that we want).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Security</strong>: Given an adversary that has limited computing power and
  bandwidth, the network will keep working and all the participants will be
  able to continue their life in the network normally. (This is a bit vague,
  but we will discuss it in the future. It's hard to discuss security without 
  having a system).</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>There are some other things that will be nice to have. We would like to be able
to deal with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denial-of-service_attack">Denial Of Service
(DoS)</a> in some way.</p>
<p>This description is far from perfect (It is not even close to being formal),
though it is a start, and we can work with it at this point. 
As a summary, if somebody on the street asks you what I
search for, it would be a <strong>secure distributed and scalable mesh network</strong>.</p>
<h3>First Naive solution</h3>

<p>Like every good researcher, we begin by trying a few simple solutions to the problem.</p>
<p>In all the following solutions we will begin by wiring every computer to a few
computers close to him (Maybe geographically). We call those few computers
close to him immediate <strong>neighbours</strong>, or just neighbours. Regarding the
participants of the network - As they might be pretty general entities, we
sometimes call them <strong>nodes</strong> instead of computers.</p>
<p>We will usually wonder how to send a message from some random node \(A\) to
another random node \(B\) on the network, given that \(A\) knows the address of
\(B\). (How \(A\) knows \(B\)'s address from the first place is another
question that we are going to deal with later, don't worry about it now).</p>
<p><img class="wimage"
src="mesh_question/a_to_b.svg"/>
(A generic schema of a mesh network. We want to send a message from \(A\) to
\(B\).)<br/><br/></p>
<h4>Flooding</h4>

<p>We program every node (Computer) in the network to forward every message it
gets to all of his neighbors.</p>
<p>To avoid loops, every node will remember the messages that it sees somehow,
and if he gets again a message that he has already seen, he will not forward it
again.</p>
<p>Let \(A,B\) be two nodes in the network. We want to send a message from
\(A\) to \(B\). To do that, \(A\) will send the message to all of his
neighbours. In turn, as we programmed all those nodes, every nodes that
gets the message will forward it to all of his neighbours, and so on.
Eventually the message will arrive at \(B\).</p>
<p>This solution will not be enough for us, because it is not scalable. Note that
sending a message from \(A\) to \(B\) involves all the nodes in the
network. This means that as a node sitting in this network, you will have
to process every message that every node sends! This is too much for large
amount of network participants.</p>
<p>Flooding is one of the oldest tricks in the book. Although it is considered to
be not very scalable, it is a very common solution. (See for example
<a href="https://bitcoin.org/">bitcoin</a> or
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gnutella">Gnutella</a>)</p>
<p>The Flooding solution has some features that are hard to achieve in other
methods:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Flooding is very simple to design and program. No special rules, just forward
  every message to all of your neighbors.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Flooding manages to route a message to its destination with a very high
  probability. Also, almost any addressing scheme will work with flooding, as
  every message arrives at all the nodes in the network.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Flooding has important security features. For example: It is very hard for an
  adversary to block a node from recieving a message destined to him. (Bitcoin,
  for example, relies on this feature for its security).</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Summary</h3>

<p>We made some progress in defining the kind of network we want, and introduced
the Flooding solution. We also explained why it will not be suitable as a
solution to our problem.</p>
